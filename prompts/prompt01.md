I would like you to give me the steps to create a vue.js / vite app (in typescript) for the idea that I will describe below.
I would like the steps to be simple and repeatable e.g. the first step should be something like create a new vue.js / vite project by typing `npm create vite@latest` at the console... etc 
Then further down the track it might be 'make a new component by creating a file called mycomp.vue and paste the following text' etc. The functionality of the app should be built up step by step, starting with minimal 'hello world' type code and adding features in each step e.g. 'now add the midi playback functionality by typing x at the command line and adding the following lines of code to file.vue'
So here's what the app should do: I want a kind of "audio visualisation" of french mobile phone numbers. That is I should be able to type in a number e.g. '06 01 02 03 04' to a big text box at the top of the page and then press a button and the following happens:
The '01 02 03 04' part of the number is turned interpreted as four midi note numbers and played back as a 'tune'.
The largest part of the screen is reserved for a quite simple 'piano roll' view of the visualsed notes that appear as rectangles on the full 88 notes of the keyboard (for the few low numbers that fall outside the low notes of the piano they are transposed up the minimum number of octaves so they appear on the piano roll display and maybe appear in a different colour).
When the mouse rolls over this piano roll area of the screen a status bar shows the current piano note (with equivalent enharmonic name if its a black key), the midi number of the note and center frequency in Hz. When the mouse is clicked on this area the midi note should be played for a short moment. Whenever the spacebar is pressed (or the 'translate to midi' button at the top is pressed), the four note phone number sequence will be played while a vertical line scrolls across the piano roll display indicating the current playback time of the sequence (this should be one of the last features added).
The core essential features (that should be sketched out in the beginning) are the ability to enter an arbirtrary phone number and press a button to hear that as a sequence of notes played.
